# macOS script

We're going to use a package manager for MacOS called [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the majority of tools.  For a handful more we'll source release binaries directly from Github repositories.

## Supported versions

- [x] macOS Mojave

## How to clone

```
git clone https://github/pacphi/pcftools
```

## How to install

```
cd builds/macOS
./install-pcftools.macos.sh
```
